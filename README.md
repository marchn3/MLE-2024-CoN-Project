Machine Learning Analysis of the Chart of Nuclides
Author: Nicholas March

Description:
This project aims to leverage the capabilities of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to delve into the complexities of the Chart of Nuclides. The primary focus of the analysis is to unearth previously unidentified patterns and garner deeper insights into the stability or lack thereof of isotopes, with a particular focus on those that are not well-documented or present significant experimental challenges. Initially, K-means clustering will be used to sift through isotopic data, pinpointing underlying patterns and crucial features. This groundwork paves the way for the subsequent phase, where logistic regression is harnessed to categorize nuclides based on their decay types, informed by the patterns identified earlier. 
Through this sophisticated analytical approach, the project aspires to broaden understanding of isotopes, especially those that have remained elusive, thus contributing valuable knowledge to the field of nuclear physics and advancing related scientific disciplines.
