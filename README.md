# Machine Learning Analysis of the Chart of Nuclides

Author: Nicholas March

Description:
This project aims to leverage the capabilities of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to delve into the complexities of the Chart of Nuclides. The primary focus of the analysis is to unearth previously unidentified patterns and garner deeper insights into the stability or lack thereof of isotopes, with a particular focus on those that are not well-documented or present significant experimental challenges. Through a sophisticated analytical approach, the project aspires to broaden understanding of isotopes, especially those that have remained elusive, thus contributing valuable knowledge to the field of nuclear physics and advancing related scientific disciplines.
